## Cannot sync the file of git

git's object file is default to 0x444 type. However, Nutstore need write it to change access time. (I guess)

Solution:

    chmod 644 git/object/*/*
    find .git/objects -type f -not -writable -exec chmod 644 {} \;

### Why have this issue?

git consider the object file is persistent. This means the object file is never changed. so permissions of these files are read only (0x444).
