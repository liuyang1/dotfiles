Version:: tmux 1.9a

Bug::
open a new pane as last pane directory need "current_pane_path" for direcoty
switch.

but when run such as man / pacman command, which cwd of these processes is 
"/usr/share/man" or "/"

so open a new pane, will switch to those directories.

Patch::
osdep-linux.c.patch

Note::
refer to a patch on sourceforge.[[http://sourceforge.net/p/tmux/mailman/message/32035774/]]

detect the cwd of Process Group, if exist, switch to that direcotry, not cwd of
foreground process.

Known issues::
need to quit all tmux process to restart tmux server, then try it again.

different version of tmux server and client, will startup failed.
